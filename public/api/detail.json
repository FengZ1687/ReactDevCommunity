I had been considering Gatsby and a few other options, but for now I'll describe my brief foray into the Redwoods.</p><p>OK, I admit....I was initially excited about the release of RedwoodJS simply because of the name. I was born and raised in Northern California, and I think Redwood trees are really quite special. Tom Preston-Werner, the author of this new JAMstack framework, chose the name for similar reasons.</p>"
